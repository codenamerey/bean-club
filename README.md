# The Bean Club
## What I Used
This site is made possible with Node, Express, and MongoDB.

## What's It For
The Bean Club is home for the "Bean" devotees... the name was from the animated film **Puss In Boots**.
It is a *member-only* site, where lurkers can see the posts, but only members can see who posted what.

## Where To Access
You can go [here for the live demo](https://bean-club.onrender.com). Signing up for an account gives The Bean Club access to your Google name, email address, and profile picture. Please do keep that in mind.
